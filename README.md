# RC_Car
This project controls an RC car using a USB gamepad and Python over Bluetooth (HC-05). It reads joystick and trigger input with pygame and sends motor commands to an Arduino via serial communication. The system supports smooth proportional control and a simple test mode for basic forward, backward, left, and right movement.
